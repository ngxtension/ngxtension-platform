# NG Extension Platform

A collection of utilities for [Angular](https://angular.dev).

## Installation

The `ng-add` schematic/generator installs the `ngxtension` package as well as turning on `skipLibCheck` TypeScript configuration if it hasn't been turned on.
This allows your project to skip checking types for external libraries like `ngxtension` where typings might not be compatible with your project's strictness.

```shell
ng add ngxtension
```

or

```shell
npm install ngxtension
```

```shell
yarn add ngxtension
```

```shell
pnpm install ngxtension
```

```shell
nx generate ngxtension:init
```
