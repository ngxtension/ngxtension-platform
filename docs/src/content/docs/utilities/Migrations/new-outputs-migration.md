In Angular v17.3, the new `output()` was released. The new `output()` function aligns better with the new `input()` and pave the road for signal components. This is the reason why `ngxtension` publishes schematics that handles the code migration for you.

### How it works?

The moment you run the schematics, it will look for all the decorators that have outputs and convert them to function based outputs.

- It will keep the same name for the outputs.
- It will keep the same types.
- It will keep the same alias if it's present.
- It will also convert Outputs that are used with observables and not with EventEmitter.

### Example:

#### Normal output:

Before:

```ts
@Output() change = new EventEmitter<string>();
```

After:

```ts
change = output<string>();
```

#### Output with alias:

Before:

```ts
@Output('change') changeAlias = new EventEmitter<string>();
```

After:

```ts
change = output<string>({ alias: 'change' });
```

#### Output with observable:

Before:

```ts
someObservable$ = of('test');
@Output() change = this.someObservable$;
```

After:

```ts
change = outputFromObservable(this.someObservable$);
```

#### Output with Subject or BehaviorSubject:

Before:

```ts
@Output() someSubject = new Subject<string>();
```

After:

```ts
someSubject = new Subject<string>();
_someSubject = outputFromObservable(this.someSubject, { alias: 'someSubject' });
```

### Usage

In order to run the schematics for all the project in the app you have to run the following script:

```bash
ng g ngxtension-plugin:convert-outputs
```

If you want to specify the project name you can pass the `--project` param.

```bash
ng g ngxtension-plugin:convert-outputs --project=<project-name>
```

If you want to run the schematic for a specific component or directive you can pass the `--path` param.

```bash
ng g ngxtension-plugin:convert-outputs --path=<path-to-ts-file>
```

### Usage with Nx

To use the schematics on a Nx monorepo you just swap `ng` with `nx`

Example:

```bash
nx g ngxtension-plugin:convert-outputs --project=<project-name>
```
